### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Using positioning to get the desired layout. That is something I know but was a bit challenging to implement.

### Continued development

I want to continue practicing, challenging myself and solving the problems that come along.

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_css_image_overlay_opacity) - This helped me to implement the positioning property and also use the opaque property. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
